To answer these questions, I hope to display the relation between the locations of institute and all the type of grants they have received within one chart. Thus, I selected the 'state' column and the 'type of award' columns, combining with the count of each type of awards. At first I swayed between line chart and histogram for visualization. If it's a histogram, I would want to generate an interactive chart like this:"

If we move our mouse on the columns, the specific number for each grant would apear. We can also click on the legend to check each grant's details. Thus as for strength of my approach, I guess this line chart can explain the relationship between location and the amount of each grants quite clearly."
