    "That's why I generated the first two plots. The difference between them is that each of them reveals a second feature of the grant. The first plot I built shows the correlation between the location of the institution and the amount of award.The size of each bubbles indicates the amount, while the color of the bubbles conveys their scale.Second plot shows the relation between the type of the grants and the location of the institustion. The visualization framework I adopted is mostly plotly, which has a nice map library to display the data and provides sound interactive functions."

To answer these questions, I hope to display the relation between the locations of institute and all the type of grants they have received within one chart. Thus, I selected the 'state' column and the 'type of award' columns, combining with the count of each type of awards. At first I swayed between line chart and histogram for visualization. If it's a histogram, I would want to generate an interactive chart like this:"

If using state names as lateral axix units, whether the height is overlaid or all start at horizontal may be confusing to some readers."

    "On the contary,in the line chart above, the height of each line are independent from each other and the area below the line shows the total amount of the grant from 1996 to 2003. If we move our mouse on the columns, the specific number for each grant would apear. We can also click on the legend to check each grant's details. Thus as for strength of my approach, I guess this line chart can explain the relationship between location and the amount of each grants quite clearly."

    "The weakness of the visualization is that I didn't choose zipcode as my studied feature, which may be a little bit more complex than using state but if I have more time I would try doing another chart with that using more data from FRED to show a better idea of the economic factors of zipcode. Also, If the states are conveyed by the map, the location of the institutions could be clearer, so another thing I want to try is building a 3D map---putting the line chart above on a USA map."
